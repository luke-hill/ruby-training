# Dice

We can roll dice, and sometimes the dice aren't fair. Here we are going to test 2 simple dice games
and work out how to write the code

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ gem install bundler # if you don't have it already
$ bundle
```

## Working through the exercise

To run the exercise, you just need to run:

```
$ rspec
```

By now you should know that to start with all of the examples will fail!

Now we need to fix the specs. There are 2 files inside the `/lib` directory that we need to edit.
These two files will tell us how to solve the following problems.
 
1. Roll any number of dice, observe their scores, and compare two people's respective rolls
1. Play a game of greed, a single player dice scoring game (Rules you need to deduce from the spec)

## Committing your work

It's important to commit your work regularly. Make sure you are working on a
branch, not master. Ideally use your commits to keep your own
comments and notes about what you've learnt. As you work through the exercises
we'll try to come back together periodically to discuss.
