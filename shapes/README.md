# Shapes

We all know that we can draw 2-dimensional shapes, such as a triangle or a square. However, how would
you check if they were correct? i.e. they could be constructed?

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ gem install bundler # if you don't have it already
$ bundle
```

## Working through the exercise

To run the exercise, you just need to run:

```
$ rspec
```

By now you should know that to start with all of the examples will fail!

Now we need to fix the specs. There are 3 files inside the `/lib` directory that we need to edit.
These three files will tell us how to solve the following problems.
 
1. Classify type of triangle, based on its side lengths
1. Classify type of 4-sided shape - based on its angles
1. What are the internal and external angles of regular 5-10 sided shapes?

## Committing your work

It's important to commit your work regularly. Make sure you are working on a
branch, not master. Ideally use your commits to keep your own
comments and notes about what you've learnt. As you work through the exercises
we'll try to come back together periodically to discuss.
