## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles
    * Are you following TDD principles?
    * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
    * Did you iterate on your work?
    * Did you do red-green-refactor?
* Pass Rate
    * Did your code pass when I ran it?
    * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis
    * Is your code neat and tidy?
    * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
    * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer)?
* Miscellaneous Criteria
    * N/A

## Grades

### Following TDD principles
C

For triangles good TDD was attempted.
For quadrilaterals it seems no TDD was attempted. Including the attempts to refactor redundant code
For angles some TDD was attempted.

The refactoring attempts were quite poor and didn't really hit the point of evolving your current code
It seems like you just deleted and started again in some instances.

### Pass Rate
A

All tests pass. Solid work.

### White box analysis
B

White box analysis of the code was good. Overall laid out well, easy to trace all of the code-flows.

I would suggest that perhaps, you spend more time on refactoring internally and less time on chopping/changing.

### Miscellaneous Criteria
N/A - Not being used for this project

### Overall Grade
B

Very good first effort. Only area to spend more time on is to get the procedure right with TDD (Red-Green-Refactor).

Also in git you very often merged the same code several times. Make sure to get your git work up to scratch.
