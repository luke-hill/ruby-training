  # They both follow a similar pattern - but the difference is in the

  # The top part and the bottom part are the same - the bread... but the
  # middle - the filling changes.
  #
  # Pulling out the top and bottom parts into a library is difficult in
  # many languages.

  # Consider the following code, where we try to start "simplifying" our
  # construct of the sandwhich, so we have re-usable code
